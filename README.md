Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. To help you understand how Django works, especially focusing on its MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture, I’ll break down the concept and guide you through setting up a simple Django project from scratch. This hands-on approach will also include creating a basic application within the project to illustrate how models, views, and templates interact within Django.

### Understanding MVT Architecture

1. **Model**: This layer is responsible for everything that relates to data (e.g., how to access it, how to validate it, what behaviors it has, and the relationships between data). In Django, models are typically defined as Python classes that define fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Django provides a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to translate these models into database tables.

2. **View**: The view responds to the user’s requests and performs the appropriate action, which could be fetching data from the model or redirecting an HTTP request based on the input from the user. In Django, views are Python functions or classes that take a web request and return a web response.

3. **Template**: Templates are files that allow you to separate the design of your webpage from the Python code that powers it. They describe how the data should be presented and are written in HTML but include Django Template Language (DTL), which provides filters and tags to inject data from the view into the HTML file.

### Setting Up a Django Project

Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up a Django project:

#### Step 1: Install Django

First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. Django can be installed easily using pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Django Project

Create a new Django project by running:

```bash
django-admin startproject mysite
cd mysite
```

This command creates a new directory called `mysite` with the necessary Django files.

#### Step 3: Run the Development Server

Start the development server to make sure everything is set up correctly:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to see the default Django welcome page.

#### Step 4: Create an Application

Django projects are made up of individual applications that you create. For example, to create a simple app:

```bash
python manage.py startapp students
```

This creates a new directory called `students` which is structured to hold your models, views, templates, and other resources.

#### Step 5: Define a Model

Inside `students/models.py`, define a simple model:

```python
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

After defining your model, you need to create a database schema for it by running:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Step 6: Create a View

Edit `students/views.py` to add a view:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import Student

def student_list(request):
    students = Student.objects.all()
    return HttpResponse(', '.join([s.name for s in students]))
```

#### Step 7: Map a URL to the View

In `students`, create a file called `urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import student_list

urlpatterns = [
    path('', student_list, name='student-list'),
]
```

Include `students` URLs in your project by editing the `urls.py` in the `mysite` directory:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('students/', include('students.urls')),
]
```

#### Step 8: Start the Server and Visit the Page

Restart your server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/` to see the output of your view, which, to begin with, will be empty until you add data into the database.

By following these steps, you will have a basic understanding of how Django's MVT architecture works in practice, with a real example of a model, a view that fetches data from that model, and basic URL routing. As you become more comfortable, you can start experimenting with templates to render HTML pages instead of just sending plain text responses.
